### IN PROGRESS

Currently: 

- HTTP server is starting on configured port and each connection is handled in a separate thread 
- basic routes are functional e.g. http://localhost:8081, http://localhost:8081/blogs, http://localhost:8081/blogs/list, 

regex checks to come for route param type, as well as general restrictions (method, header etc)
